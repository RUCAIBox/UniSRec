*Updates*:

* [Nov. 22, 2022] We added scripts and implementations of baselines FDSA and S^3-Rec [[link]](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/UniSRec/issues/4#issuecomment-1316045022).
* [June 28, 2022] We updated some useful "mid product" files that can be obtained during the data preprocessing stage [[link]](dataset#useful-files), including:
  1. Clean item text (`*.text`);
  2. Index mapping between raw IDs and remapped IDs (`*.user2index`, `*.item2index`);
* [June 16, 2022] We released the code and scripts for  preprocessing ours datasets [[link]](dataset#dataset-preprocessing).

## Overview

We propose **UniSRec**, which stands for **Uni**versal **S**equence representation learning for **Rec**ommendation. Aiming to learn more generalizable sequence representations, UniSRec utilizes the associated description text of an item to learn transferable representations across different domains and platforms. For learning *universal item representations*, we design a lightweight architecture based on parametric whitening and mixture-of-experts enhanced adaptor. For learning *universal sequence representations*, we introduce two kinds of contrastive learning tasks by sampling multi-domain negatives. With the pre-trained universal sequence representation model, our approach can be effectively transferred to new cross-domain and cross-platform recommendation scenarios in a parameter-efficient way, under either inductive or transductive settings.

## Download Datasets and Pre-trained Model

Please download the processed downstream (or pre-trained, if needed) datasets and the pre-trained model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Uik0fMk4oquV_bS9lXTZuExAYbIDkEMW?usp=sharing) or [百度网盘](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zdP3tEw9X6Ys5YNO5TyNEQ) (密码 3cml).

After unzipping, move `pretrain/` and `downstream/` to `dataset/`, and move `UniSRec-FHCKM-300.pth` to `saved/`.

## Quick Start

### Train and evaluate on downstream datasets

Fine-tune the pre-trained UniSRec model in transductive setting.

```
python finetune.py -d Scientific -p saved/UniSRec-FHCKM-300.pth
```

*You can replace `Scientific` to `Pantry`, `Instruments`, `Arts`, `Office` or `OR` to reproduce the results reported in our paper.*

Fine-tune the pre-trained model in inductive setting.

```
python finetune.py -d Scientific -p saved/UniSRec-FHCKM-300.pth --train_stage=inductive_ft
```

Train UniSRec from scratch (w/o pre-training).

```
python finetune.py -d Scientific
```

Run baseline SASRec.

```
python run_baseline.py -m SASRec -d Scientific --config_files=props/finetune.yaml --hidden_size=300
```

Please refer to [[link]](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/UniSRec/issues/4#issuecomment-1316045022) for more scripts of our baselines.

### Pre-train from scratch

Pre-train on one single GPU.

```
python pretrain.py
```

Pre-train with distributed data parallel on GPU:0-3.

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python ddp_pretrain.py
```

### Customized Datasets

Please refer to [[link]](dataset#dataset-preprocessing) for details of data preprocessing. Then you can correspondingly try your customized datasets.
